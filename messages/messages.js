      `OH HAI`,

    Help: [
      `I can control Burke's LIFX connected bulb. You can say things like "Turn the lamp off" or "change the color to blue".`,
      `I know a few commands, like how to turn Burke's lamp on and off, as well as change the color. The color supports some named colors and any hex value. If you get it wrong, I'll tell you. 😉`

    ThankYou: [
      `You're Welcome. I mean, I'm a robot so it's not like I really have a choice.`,

      `No problem! 👍`,
